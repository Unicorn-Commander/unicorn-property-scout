# SearXNG Real Estate Edition

## 1. Overview

This project is a specialized version of the SearXNG metasearch engine, tailored for the real estate industry. The goal is to create a vertical search appliance that prioritizes real estate-specific sources, providing more relevant results for professionals and consumers in this sector.

This project was forked from the existing SearXNG instance running in `~/UC-1/UC-1_Core`.

## 2. How to Run

The application is fully containerized using Docker. To start the services, run the following command from the project root directory (`~/Development/SearXNG-Real-Estate`):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start two services:
- `unicorn-searxng-real-estate`: The main SearXNG application.
- `unicorn-redis-real-estate`: A dedicated Redis instance for caching.

The SearXNG instance is configured to be available at `http://<host_ip>:18888`.

## 3. Configuration

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines the services, ports, volumes, and environment variables for the Docker containers.
- **`searxng/settings.yml`**: The main configuration file for SearXNG. This is where you can define search engines, result formatting, UI settings, and more.
- **`searxng/uwsgi.ini`**: Configuration for the uWSGI application server.
- **`.env`**: Contains environment variables, including the `SEARXNG_SECRET` and credentials for external services like the BrightData proxy. **This file should not be committed to version control.**

## 4. Troubleshooting

### Container Startup Issues

If you encounter the error `no python application found`, this is typically due to configuration mismatches. The following issues have been resolved:

1. **File Ownership**: The SearXNG container runs under user ID 3000. Files must have correct ownership:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R 3000:3000 searxng/
   ```

2. **Port Configuration**: All configuration files must use consistent ports. This instance uses port 18888:
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Port mapping and health check
   - `searxng/settings.yml`: Server port setting  
   - `searxng/uwsgi.ini`: HTTP socket configuration

3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure the `.env` file contains the required `SEARXNG_SECRET` and `SEARXNG_REDIS_URL` variables.

### Verification

After starting the containers, verify the instance is working:
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:18888/
```
A response of `200` indicates the service is running correctly.
