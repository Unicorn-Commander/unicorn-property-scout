*Example: - [X] This is a completed task - @Gemini*

## Setup & Configuration

- [X] Create new project directory at `~/Development/SearXNG-Real-Estate`. - @Gemini
- [X] Copy base project files from `~/UC-1/UC-1_Core`. - @Gemini
- [X] Isolate the project by creating a minimal `docker-compose.yml` with only `searxng` and `redis`. - @Gemini
- [X] Update container names, volumes, network, and ports to avoid conflicts. - @Gemini
- [X] Copy and adapt configuration from the original working instance (`settings.yml`, `uwsgi.ini`, `.env`). - @Gemini
- [X] **[RESOLVED]** Resolve the container startup issue (`no python application found`). - @Claude-Sonnet-4
- [X] **[RESOLVED]** Fix "Invalid value: "real_estate"" theme error. - @Gemini (Theme directory now correctly mounted as a volume)

**Issues Fixed:**
  - Fixed file ownership (changed from UID 977 to UID 3000 as required by SearXNG container)
  - Aligned port configuration across all files to use port 18888:
    - docker-compose.yml: Updated port mapping and health check
    - settings.yml: Updated server port
    - uwsgi.ini: Updated http-socket port
  - Fixed Redis URL configuration to use environment variable
  - **Status**: âœ… Instance now running successfully on http://localhost:18888

## Theme & UI/UX Refinement

- [X] Implement advanced search filters. - @Gemini
- [X] Customize results display. - @Gemini

## API Integration

- [X] Customize `settings.yml` to add real estate-specific search engines (e.g., Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com). - @Gemini (US Census Bureau, OpenStreetMap/Nominatim, RentCast, SchoolDigger, and Bing Maps API engines added as placeholders and basic engine files created)
- [ ] Integrate US Census Bureau API (requires API key and documentation).
